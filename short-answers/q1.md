# Question

What is the difference between how instance methods/properties and class methods/properties are created? What is the difference between how they are used?

# Answer
The difference is that the properties/methods of a class is owned by the class. When creating them, the term `static` is in front of them. To use them, one would do `[classname].[property]`.
